## Repulsion Based Fractal Model

The Repulsion Based Fractal (RBF) model is based on the Song-Havlin-Makse model, it also evolved through time, and we rewire edges to create repulsion among nodes. However, here the probability of an edge to be rewired is not fixed, but depends on the degree of its endpoints. In contrast to the Song-Havlin-Makse model, repulsion is always present in RBFM, moreover, with a predefined parameter we can specify the nodes that repel each other (e.g., hubs or small degree nodes).

## Lattice Small-world Transition Model

The Lattice Small-world Transition Model (LSwTM) utilizes the fractal nature of grid-like structures, and at the same time works against it with the preferential attachment mechanism.
